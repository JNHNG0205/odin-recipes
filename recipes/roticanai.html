    <p>With a crispy, crunchy exterior and a stretchy, chewy interior, these Malaysian flatbread (roti canai) are easier

        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>&frac12; teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>&frac12; teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>&frac14; cup tomato paste</li>
        <li>3 cups cold water</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can full-fat coconut milk</li>

        <li>&frac14; cup unsalted butter, melted, or more as needed</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped serrano pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine bread flour, sugar, kosher salt, egg, melted butter, and water for roti canai in a mixing bowl. Mix
            with your hands until a shaggy dough forms. Transfer to a work surface and knead until a smooth, elastic
            dough forms, about 7 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Divide dough into 8 equal pieces and form each one into a ball. Coat each ball with vegetable oil, transfer
            to a plate, and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 8 hours, to overnight.</li><br>
        <li>Melt butter for dip in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion, ginger, garlic, kosher salt, curry
            powder, paprika, cumin, black pepper, and cayenne pepper; stir together and saute until onion has softened
            and spices are fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and cook until it starts to toast and
            caramelize on the bottom of the pan, about 3 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Stir in cold water and coconut milk. Add lentils; stir and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and
            simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 40 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings. Reduce heat to
            low and keep warm while you prepare the roti canai.</li><br>
        <li>Place 1/4 cup melted butter in a bowl. Transfer rested dough balls onto a lightly oiled work surface.
            Flatten each ball slightly and rub a little melted butter on top. Cover dough with plastic wrap and let it
            warm up slightly, about 10 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Press on top of the plastic wrap to flatten warmed dough. Remove plastic wrap and add a bit more butter.
            Stretch each piece from the center out to get it as thin as possible (until almost see-through), adding more
            butter as needed. Don't worry if there are a few small tears.</li><br>
        <li>Sprinkle on more melted butter, then pull two sides in towards the center until touching and overlapping
            slightly. Pull the other two edges in the same way to form a square. Cover with plastic wrap and flatten
            roti canai one more time.</li><br>
        <li>Add some melted butter to a skillet set over medium or medium-low heat. Add roti canai and cook until
            browned, flaky, and crispy on the outside and fully cooked through on the inside, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
        </li><br>
        <li>Remove from the skillet and smush it with your hands to fluff it up and separate the layers of dough. Repeat
            to cook remaining roti canai.</li><br>
        <li>Sprinkle the curried red lentil dip with cilantro and sliced serrano peppers and serve alongside the roti
            canai.</li><br>
    </ol>
